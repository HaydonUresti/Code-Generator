# Overview

Code-Generator is a web app that allows a user to encode a given string and decode strings based on the app's encoding.

After the repository is cloned, install the necessary libraries by entering the following lines into the terminal:

- npm install
- npm i react
- npm i react-router-dom

After that, start a test server by running: npm start.
Code-Generator will then open up in your web browser.

Code-Generator is a web app project I created to help me practice JavaScript skills as well as learn React JS.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Web Pages

Code-Generator consists of 3 web pages, a home/about page, an encrypt page, and a decrypt page. The app uses the react-router library to transition between pages. Each page is dynamic and will change layout depending on the size of the screen. They are also dynamic in that they each display a value unique to the client. The home page will display the number of time that user has started Code-Generator. The encrypt and decrypt pages show the user how many times they have encrypted or decrypted a string respectively.

# Development Environment

Code Generator was written using Visual Studio Code.

It was written in JavaScript using React JS.
The library react-router-dom was also used to handle routing between pages.

# Future Work

- In future updates, I would like to improve string encoding, to make it more difficult to be solved
- Include more kinds of encoding, giving the user the option to choose what level of encoding is used
- Improve the web pages visually
