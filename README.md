# Overview

Code-Generator is a web app that allows a user to encode a given string and decode strings based on the app's encoding.

After the repository is cloned, install the necessary libraries by entering the following lines into the terminal:

- npm install
- npm i react
- npm i react-router-dom

After that, start a test server by running: npm start.
Code-Generator will then open up in your web browser.

Code-Generator is a web app project I created to help me practice JavaScript skills as well as learn React JS.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
